preparation:
1. heat tablespoon oil in a pan and add 2 green cardamoms.
2. Then add 1 cup cubed onions & fry stirring often until they turn transparent to light
pink.
3. Next add 1½ cup tomatoes & ¾ teaspoon salt. Saute for 3 minutes.
4. Cover and cook till the onion & tomatoes turns soft & completely mushy.
5. Next add in ¾ to 1 teaspoon garam masala, 1 teaspoon coriander powder, 12 cashew
nuts, ¾ to 1 teaspoon red chili powder & ¾ teaspoon sugar (optional).
6. Fry this till the onion tomato masala turns aromatic. This takes 2 to 3 minutes.
7. Turn off the stove & cool this completely.
8. Transfer to a blender with 1 cup water. Blend to a really silky smooth puree. If it is not
smooth, then filter it through a strainer to another bowl. Set this aside.

HOW TO MAKE 

1. Heat 1½ tablespoon butter in the same pan.
2. Optional - When the butter melts, add ½ inch cinnamon, 3 cloves, 2 green cardamoms
& 1 small bay leaf.
3. Reduce the flame to low, saute 1½ teaspoon ginger garlic paste for 1 minute. It should
begin to smell good and the raw smell should go away. Do not burn this as it will leave
a bitter taste.
4. Pour the blended onion tomato puree. (optional - At this step sometimes I add ¼
teaspoon more red chili powder to adjust the color).
5. Pour ½ cup water & mix well. Cover & cook on a medium heat until the gravy thickens
& traces of butter or oil is seen on top. Keep checking in between and give a good mix.
6. When the gravy is done, it will turn thick and traces of fats will be visible on the gravy.
Taste test the gravy and add more salt if needed.
7. Lower the flame completely, then add 200 to 250 grams paneer. Take 1 teaspoon
kasuri methi to your palm and crush it in between your palms. Sprinkle this.
8. Mix & cook covered on a low heat for 2 minutes. Turn off and pour 2 to 3 tablespoons of
cream & stir.
9. Transfer paneer butter masala to a serving bowl. Garnish with 1 tablespoon cream & 2
tbsps chopped coriander leaves. Serve this with butter naan or jeera rice.
